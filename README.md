# Recommender System

### Description
This project's aim is to create predict good recommandation for films. Each user gives appreciations on films with grades that are integers between 0 and 5.

### Getting Started
This version was designed for python 3.6.6 or higher. To run the model's calculation, it is only needed to execute the file `run.py`. On the terminal, the command is `python run.py`. The code should return a `results.csv` file with all its predictions, from the test data.

### Prerequisites
The following librairies are used:
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.14.3, can be obtained through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), also available through anaconda
* [surprise](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): `pip install scikit-surprise`
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): `pip install -U scikit-learn`
* [keras](https://keras.io/): `pip install Keras`
* [tensor flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/): `pip install tensorflow`


To lunch the code `run.py` use the following codes:
* `helpers.py`
*

A `data` folder is also needed where training data is stored. The train data launched for this project is `data_train.csv`.
